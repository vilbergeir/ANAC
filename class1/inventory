# 3a. Create a simple inventory file my-inventory.
# It should have only an entry for the local group and localhost.
#
# 4a. Expand your inventory file to include a 'cisco' group
# and two Cisco routers ('pynet-rtr1' and 'pynet-rtr2').
# These devices should have the ip addresses of '184.105.247.70'
# and '184.105.247.71' respectively.
# Use the ansible_host variable for the IP addresses.
# Make sure you that you also specify the following two variables
# (for both of the routers):
#
# replace 'kbyers' with the name of your home directory
# ansible_connection=local
# ansible_python_interpreter=/home/kbyers/VENV/ansible/bin/python
